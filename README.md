## Now it's your turn to use string methods. 

?: Get enthusiastic about ruby! How do I print out "I love ruby" in all caps?

( ) "I love Ruby".swapcase
(X) "I love Ruby".upcase
( ) "I love Ruby".uppercase

?: Use a method to print out how long the sentence "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?" is

(X) "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?".length
( ) "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?".swapcase
( ) "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?".printlength


?: It's backwards day! How would you print "backwards" backwards?

( ) "backwards".length
( ) "backwards".backwards
(X) "backwards".reverse

?: Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always capitalized the first letter of a string? There is! "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!"

( ) "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".upcase
( ) "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".swapcase
(X) "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".capitalize

?: How much do we love "Ruby"? So much that we want to say it in all caps AND backwards. How would you do this?

( ) "Ruby".reverse.swapcase
(X) "Ruby".upcase.reverse
